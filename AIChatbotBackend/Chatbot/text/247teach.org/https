Frequently Asked Questions - College Admissions Counseling and Support:
24/7 Teach is different from other admissions consultants because 24/7 Teach covers all aspects of teen development, including life, academic, and career skill development through real world projects. 24/7 Teach offers a plethora of extracurricular activity opportunities and academic supports that work to holistically develop your teen to be completely ready to not only apply and get accepted to college but to excel in college, their careers, and in life. By working with 24/7 Teach, your teen will become college, career, and life ready.
24/7 Teach's services don't only help teens looking for admittance to Ivy League schools, but rather 24/7 Teach works with teens seeking admission to various competitive universities and high school programs within the U.S.
The right time to start thinking about college admissions is in 8th and 9th grade, which is when teens should start planning. If your teen is 10th grade or higher, the time to plan is now. Teens are rarely self-motivated at this age, so parents have to take responsibility for helping their children to plan. Ideal teens walk into their first day of high school with a list of extracurricular activities to explore and specialize in 1-2 activities by 10th grade. By 11th grade, a teen's college candidacy is mostly set, but quick intervention can still help juniors qualify for higher-tier admissions than they otherwise would.
When it comes to when colleges start looking at your grades, universities will often disregard freshman-year grades and always value grades from 11th grade as most indicative of a teen's maturity and academic performance.
The big benefit of hiring a college admissions coach is that they serve as an intermediary between parents and teens, provide clear expert advice and structure, and understand what universities want in an applicant. "...going into the admissions process alone is like going to court without a lawyer," as said by a teen from the 24/7 Teach class of 2019.
24/7 Teach's process is beginning by developing an understanding of each teen's goals and perspective and teach parents how they can best support their child. By indentifying the strengths and passions of each teen, 24/7 Teach provides them with opportunities to develop and capitalize on needs or problems in their community. From here, 24/7 Teach helps each teen build projects that make the world better and showcase their candidacy. Finally, 24/7 Teach helps teens explore which schools are compatible with these interests and help them find their voice through admissions essays, focusing on conveying an authentic, mature self to their target schools.
24/7 Teach does work with international teens, with about 50% of the 24/7 teen community being based outside of North America.
When it comes to technology requirements, 24/7 Teach's College counseling sessions can be accessed by any device with internet access and is completed via the 24/7 Teach app, (Course) Zoom (Video Conferencing), and Slack (Communication). You can participate anywhere you can access the Internet.
When it comes to the success rate 24/7 Teach has had in working with teens, in 2022, 84% of 24/7 Teach teens gained acceptance to their top-choice school. 100% of 24/7 Teach's teens were accepted to college.
If you are a rising senior that is behind in the application process, it is not too late for 24/7 Teach to help you. Every year, 24/7 Teach gets a few teens who call in with weeks on the clock and rush with 24/7 Teach to finalize fantastic essays and applications. Also, teens rejected from their first choice school reach out to 24/7 Teach, and 24/7 Teach rushes to help them wrap up strong applications before the end of December.
When it comes to things that high school freshman and sophomores can do to prepare for the application process, they should focus on exploring interests and applying the skills they learn with small-scale projects around their school, community, or in connection with an organization. 24/7 Teach offers the necessary extracurricular activities, academic guidance and support, and scholarship information to ensure first- and second-year high school students fully understand what is required to successfully get admitted to the right college for them.
