Some Kind Words from a few 24/7 Superstars:




















“The guidance and coaching from 24/7 Teach, helped me develop a resume that received compliments from the hiring manager, and the group-mock interview helped me be relaxed and fully prepared, so much so, that there was only one interview question that was new to me.”— Srividhya S.

 


















“Learning how to understand the mindset in candidates that companies are looking for has helped me identify positions to apply for that are right for me. My big take away is to identify positions that I can immediately and authentically provide value in companies that align with my principles.”— Rob G.
